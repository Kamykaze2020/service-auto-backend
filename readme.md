# Service-auto Backend Application in Typescript

This is the backend application for the **Proiect Internship Info World 2025**, built with **TypeScript**, **Express**, **Prisma**, and **SQLite**.  
It provides a RESTful API to manage.

Having experience with Django and with using Swagger I decided to implement it in this typescript project too, for better clarity of API Classes and a better documentation.
